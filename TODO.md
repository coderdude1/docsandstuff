# General

# Organiszation
* create basic folder structure.  How do I want to structure stuff?
* Searching?
* How to do linking?
* Maybe use obsidian to manage the relationships?  ie a new set of templates for docs, verify that I can commit the linking between docs
* Tagging?  Obisidan supports this, research it and alternatives

# Sharing
* Obisdian is a good start I think as it offers a lot of neat document  mangaement features.
* Docusaurus?  Probably host on AWS?  Cost?
