[Obsidan](https://obsidian.md/) is a nice markdown editor for taking notes, and offers a lot of ways to organize and structure documents.  It uses 
a non-proprietary files (markdown) and offers neat ways to strucutre and relate information.  I'm pretty sure we can try this using git as a common repo
and share stuff in a version controlled fashion.  They offer a non-free backend to sync/share stuff but for now I think git will be good enough.

# TODO
* does obsidan allow committing and pushing it's internal linkage and maps to git?
